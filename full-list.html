    <h1>Full List of Reasons</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>I like you because of your sense of humour, whenever I make brainrot jokes or sometimes even offensive ones, you always understand them and laugh along with me.</li>
      <li>I like you because of your cheeks, I know you're insecure about it but honestly that's one of the things that I most like about you. It looks so fluffy and cute.</li>
      <li>I like you because of your height, this is self explanatory.</li>
      <li>I like you because of your mental strength. You've been through so much but you still get up on your feet and move on. I really admire you for that.</li>
      <li>I like you because of your kindness. No matter who it is and the reason, you still find a way to be kind and that really moved me.</li>
      <li>I like you because of your hair. You have a similar dye to mine and I feel like we have such good taste in dye colours.</li>
      <li>I like you because of your taste in food. I still can't believe I found someone that has such similar taste in food as me, the only other person that have similar food taste other than us is my mom.</li>
      <li>I like you because of your nose. It looks so boop-able.</li>
      <li>I like you because of your cat eyes. I would do anything to stare into them and get lost in them.</li>
      <li>I like you because you trust me. I trust you too and I'm really happy that even with trust issues, you trust me.</li>
      <li>I like you because of the time we spent together. Whether it was us playing Minecraft when we first met or just talking about ourselves, I love the time we've spent.</li>
      <li>I like you because you reassure me quite a lot. I love reassurance and that you taking your time to reassure me just makes me feel treasured.</li>
      <li>I like you because you are similar to me. I also apologize a lot, i also have low self esteem (both of us should fix that) and I just feel really relatable to you.</li>
      <li>I like you because you wear glasses. I like glasses.</li>
      <li>I don't like you. Why? I love you, Yumi. Growing up in such a loving family I know what love is and I don't use it loosely. But believe me, I do really love you Yumi.</li>
